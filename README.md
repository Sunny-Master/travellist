## Overview ‚ú® 
**Travellist**üß≥‚úàÔ∏èüì∑ is an app to make a list of your visited places/destinations. Users/Travellers can add their visited destinations with the details of their visit and experience along with an image to save it as a memory to checkout in future. 

## Motivation üß† 
Travelling is my favorite hobby as it gives me a great joy to explore this world, its distinct cultures, architecture, natural wonders and create memories. I have always struggled to find options to store specific details of the places I have visited to refer to them in future or to just go down that memory lane again. Hence, I thought of creating an app to just do that.
