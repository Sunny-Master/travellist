## Overview ‚ú® 
**Travellist**üß≥‚úàÔ∏èüì∑ is an app to make a list of your visited places/destinations. Users/Travellers can add their visited destinations with the details of their visit and experience along with an image to save it as a memory to checkout in future. 

## Motivation üß† 
Travelling is my favorite hobby as it gives me a great joy to explore this world, its distinct cultures, architecture, natural wonders and create memories. I have always struggled to find options to store specific details of the places I have visited to refer to them in future or to just go down that memory lane again. Hence, I thought of creating an app to just do that.

> Please refer to the [iTravel](https://github.com/Sunny-Master/iTravel) repository for the same app, which is built using locally installed Django and other libraries, and utilizes AWS S3 instead of Cloudinary for image file uploads. [Click here](https://travellist-617c1b2be415.herokuapp.com/) for the deployed version of that app.
